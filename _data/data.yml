career-profile: 
    title: About Me
    text:  I am a third-year PhD student majoring in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University, expected to graduate in June 2025. My research focuses on ubiquitous sensing systems for indoor monitoring utilizing optical wireless communication and energy-harvesting technologies. 
           I am jointly trained by Tsinghua University and Pengcheng Laboratory, under the Industrial Intelligence Laboratory led by Academicians Wen Gao and Weihua Gui. My advisors are Associate Professor Wenbo Ding (recipient of the National Overseas High-Level Talent Program for Young Scholars) and Associate Research Fellow Xiaojun Liang. My doctoral research centers on human-centered indoor sensing systems, addressing key technologies in three areas: contact-based sensing, non-contact sensing, and spatial indoor activity recognition.
           To date, I have published 18 academic papers, including 12 as the first author. Among them, 11 papers are published in SCI Q2 journals or conferences recommended by authoritative directories such as the Chinese Computer Federation (CCF) in categories B or higher. I have participated in multiple international conferences, receiving an annual Excellent Paper Award and a Best Oral Presentation Award. My research has been positively cited and reviewed by numerous renowned scholars, including nearly ten internationally recognized academicians and Fellows (e.g., Academician You Zheng, President of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Wang Zhonglin, a four-academy academician and winner of the Eni Award, also known as the Nobel Prize for Energy). My works have garnered over 160 citations to date.
           In terms of international experience, I spent one academic year as an undergraduate exchange student at the University of California, Berkeley, and one semester at Fu Jen Catholic University in Taiwan. As a master’s student, I earned an MS degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from UC Berkeley (ranked 3rd in the U.S. by US News in this field). During my PhD, I participated in a summer research program at the University of Oxford, supported by Tsinghua University’s Overseas Research Training Program for Counselors.
    # I am a PhD student majoring in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on ubiquitous sensing systems for indoor monitoring.
    # My research focuses on Smart Sensing, Robotics, Control, and Computer Vision. I got my bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and I was an exchange student at UC Berkeley in my sophomore year. Currently, I am a master's student at Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute. I will receive my MSc in Data Science from Tsinghua University and MEng in Industrial Engineering and Operation Research (IEOR) from UC Berkeley in June 2022.
    #I'm interested in using ML/CV to help robots acquire perception and behave automatically towards complex tasks.
