career-profile: 
    title: About Me
    text:  I am a PhD student majoring in Data Science and Information Technology at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on ubiquitous sensing systems for indoor monitoring.
    # My research focuses on Smart Sensing, Robotics, Control, and Computer Vision. I got my bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and I was an exchange student at UC Berkeley in my sophomore year. Currently, I am a master's student at Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute. I will receive my MSc in Data Science from Tsinghua University and MEng in Industrial Engineering and Operation Research (IEOR) from UC Berkeley in June 2022.
    #I'm interested in using ML/CV to help robots acquire perception and behave automatically towards complex tasks.
