career-profile: 
    title: Career Profile
    text:  My research focuses on Robotics, Control and Computer Vision. I got my Bacherlor's Degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and currently I am a master student in Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute. I will receive my MSc from THU and MEng from UCB in early 2022.
    #I'm interested in using ML/CV to help robots acquire perception and behave automatically towards complex tasks.
